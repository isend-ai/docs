> Learn how to authenticate and interact with the isend.ai API, including base URL, headers, error codes, and limits.

## Base URL

All requests to the isend.ai API must use **HTTPS** and follow RESTful conventions.

**Base URL:**

```
https://api.isend.ai
```

Requests over plain HTTP are rejected for security reasons.

## Authentication

Authenticate your requests by including your **API key** in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer token format.

```
Authorization: Bearer is_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can generate an API key from the isend.ai dashboard.

## Response Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of requests.

| Status | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | The request was successful.             |
| `400`  | Invalid request. Check your parameters. |
| `401`  | Missing or malformed API key.           |
| `403`  | API key is invalid or unauthorized.     |
| `404`  | Resource not found.                     |
| `429`  | Rate limit exceeded.                    |
| `5xx`  | Server-side error. Try again later.     |

## Rate Limits

The default rate limit is **2 requests per second** per API key. If your integration requires a higher limit, contact support to request an increase.

When you exceed the rate limit, youâ€™ll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
