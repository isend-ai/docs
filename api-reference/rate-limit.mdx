> Understand rate limits and how to increase them when using the isend.ai API.

The isend.ai API uses response headers to indicate your current rate limit status, following the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):

| Header name           | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum number of requests allowed within a window.                 |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | How many requests you have left within the current window.          |
| `ratelimit-reset`     | How many seconds until the limits are reset.                        |
| `retry-after`         | How many seconds you should wait before making a follow-up request. |

The default rate limit is **2 requests per second**. Trusted senders may request an increase.

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a `429` response error. To review these events, filter for status `429` in your [isend.ai logs](https://isend.ai/logs?status=429).

### Tips to Avoid Rate Limits

- Implement a queueing system for API calls.
- Throttle or stagger requests to prevent bursts.
- Avoid sending requests concurrently unless necessary.
- Monitor your usage through headers in API responses.

If you have unique needs or expect higher traffic, [contact our support team](https://isend.ai/contact) to request a rate increase.
